		* This release also contains several enhancements, cleanups and bugfixes:
		* Features:
			- This release contains first release of Efficient Dimensionality Reduction Toolkit (EDRT).
			- Support for new SWIG -builtin python interface feature (SWIG 2.0.4 is required now).
			- EDRT algorithms are now available using static interfaces such as matlab and octave.
			- Jensen-Shannon kernel and Homogeneous kernel map preprocessor (thanks to Viktor Gal).
			- New 'multiclass' module for multiclass classification algorithms, generic linear
			  and kernel multiclass machines, multiclass LibLinear and OCAS wrappers,
			  new rejection schemes concept by Sergey Lisitsyn.
			- Various multitask learning algorithms including L1/Lq multitask group lasso logistic regression
			  and least squares regression, L1/L2 multitask tree guided group lasso logistic regression 
			  and least squares regression, trace norm regularized multitask logistic regression, clustered multitask 
			  logistic regression and L1/L2 multitask group logistic regression by Sergey Lisitsyn.
			- Group and tree-guided logistic regression for binary and multiclass problems by Sergey Lisitsyn.
			- Mahalanobis distance, QDA, Stochastic Proximity Embedding,
			  generic OvO multiclass machine and CoverTree and KNN integation (thanks to Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia).
			- Structured output learning framework by Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia.
			- Hidden markov support vector machine structured output model by Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia.
			- Implementations of three Bundle method for risk minimization (BMRM) variants by Michal Uricar.
			- Latent SVM framework and latent detector example by Viktor Gal.
			- Gaussian processes framework for parameters selection and gaussian processes regression estimation
			  framework by Jacob Walker.
			- New graphical python modular examples.
			- Standard Cross-Validation splitting for regression problems by Heiko Strathmann
			- New data-locking concept by Heiko Strathmann which allows to tell machines that data
			  is not going to change during training/testing until unlocked.
			  KernelMachines now make use of that by not recomputing kernel matrix in cross-validation.
			- Cross-validation for KernelMachines is now parallelized.
			- Cross-validation is now possible with custom kernels.
			- Features may now have arbritarily many index subsets (of subsets (of subsets (...))).
			- Various clustering measures, Least Angle Regression and new multiclass strategies
			  concept (thanks to Chiyuan Zhang).
			- A bunch of multiclass learning algorithms including the ShareBoost algorithm, ECOC framework,
			  conditional probability tree, balanced conditional probability tree, random conditional probability
			  tree and relaxed tree by Chiyuan Zhang.
			- Python Sparse matrix typemap for octave modular interface (thanks to Evgeniy Andreev).
			- Newton SVM port (thanks to Harshit Syal).
			- Some progress on native windows compilation using 
			  cmake and mingw-w64 (thanks to Josh aka jklontz).
			- CMake compilation improvements (thanks to Eric aka yoo).
		* Bugfixes:
			- Fix for bug in the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, its domain was
			  changed to log-space.
			- Fix for R_static interface installation (thanks Steve Lianoglou).
			- SVMOcas memsetting and max_train_time bugfix.
			- Various fixes for compile errors with clang.
			- Stratified-cross-validation now used different indices for each run.
		* Cleanup and API Changes:
			- Various code cleanups by Evan Shelhamer
			- Parameter migration framework by Heiko Strathmann. From now on,
			  changes in the shogun objects will not break loading old serialized
			  files anymore
